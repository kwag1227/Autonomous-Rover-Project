# Autonomous Rover Project

This repository contains all design files, software, and documentation for an all-terrain, six-legged rover capable of navigating rough terrain and collecting environmental samples. It is a personal robotics project focused on demonstrating skills in embedded systems, motor control, and computer vision.

## üöÄ Project Goals

- Navigate difficult terrain using a rocker-bogie suspension system
- Collect and store small samples (e.g., rocks or soil)
- Avoid untraversable obstacles using computer vision
- Showcase design and control of a multi-motor robotic system
- Implement ROS into software coding

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- /mechanical design          CAD files & mechanical designs
- /electrical schematics      PCB schematics & electrical diagrams
- /vision                     Computer vision and object detection scripts  
- /docs                       Design notes and planning documents 
- /tests                      Testing scripts and logs  
- /media                      Images or videos of the rover in progress
- /references                 Reference images that I gathered from online
- /archives                   Outdated documents/files that are no longer in use
- README.md                   Project overview and documentation
