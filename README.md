# Autonomous Rover Project

This repository contains all design files, software, and documentation for an all-terrain, six-legged rover capable of navigating rough terrain and collecting environmental samples. It is a personal robotics project focused on demonstrating skills in embedded systems, motor control, and computer vision.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Navigate difficult terrain using a six-legged walking mechanism
- Collect and store small samples (e.g., rocks or soil)
- Avoid untraversable obstacles using computer vision
- Showcase design and control of a multi-motor robotic system
