# Autonomous Rover Project

This repository contains all design files, software, and documentation for an all-terrain, six-legged rover capable of navigating rough terrain and collecting environmental samples. It is a personal robotics project focused on demonstrating skills in embedded systems, motor control, and computer vision.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Navigate difficult terrain using a six-legged walking mechanism
- Collect and store small samples (e.g., rocks or soil)
- Avoid untraversable obstacles using computer vision
- Showcase design and control of a multi-motor robotic system

## 📁 Repository Structure

- /code            Microcontroller firmware and Raspberry Pi software  
- /design          CAD files and mechanical designs  
- /vision          Computer vision and object detection scripts  
- /docs            Design notes, planning documents, schematics  
- /tests           Testing scripts and logs  
- /media           Images or videos of the rover in progress  
- README.md        Project overview and documentation  

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Raspberry Pi 3 (with OpenCV for computer vision)
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or ESP32) for motor control
- Python and C++
- Custom leg mechanism with 4 motors
- ROS (planned for future integration)

## 🛠️ Current Progress

- [x] CAD design for rover body and leg mechanism
- [x] Basic motor control code for walking gait
- [ ] Sample collection system
- [ ] Obstacle detection via vision system
- [ ] Field testing

## 📝 To Do

- Finalize leg kinematics
- Integrate vision with movement logic
- Improve sample storage mechanism
- Create simulation environment (optional)

## 📷 Media

*Add photos or videos here later — even prototype pictures are great!*
